Littlepay Java Coding exercise:
This was created using maven in IntelliJ.
I have the following assumptions:
The taps.csv file is present in the running directory.
All data in taps.csv is correctly formatted and in date order.
There is no missing taps and therefore no tap offs without a tap on.
All trips are within the same bus and same company.
For incomplete trips a blank space is in the place of the end date and location.

To be run locally (requires maven):
1: mvn package
This will package the application into a jar file in the target directory.
There is one warning relating to the assignment of List to List<Journey> in argumentCaptor in TripProcessorIT which I'm aware of but unsure how to fix without spending more time than I think its worth.

2: java -jar target/ticketCalc-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Will run the application.
It will create a file called trips.csv in the current directory assuming a corresponding taps.csv is also in the current directory.
There is a taps.csv and trips.csv currently in the directory.
This is my test csv and the output it produces.
